# Haskell Julia & Mandelbrot sets

This folder contains code for fractal computation in Haskell.

In its current version, the code aims to be correct instead of performant. This means parallelism is not implemented yet.
The aim is to provide a correct design that covers all use cases and is testable.

Another aim is to be able to use a simple `cli` to execute it and read a configuration file.

## Use cases

### UC1 - TODO

TODO

## Implementation files

* Complex.hs -- Complex numbers implementation.
* Main.hs -- The main stuff.
